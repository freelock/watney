Plan for notifications:

Add a paginateEventTimeline which works on the Notification eventTimeLine

Have Room.addEventToTimeline() add to the Notification eventTimeLine too

Customise TimeLinePanel to support variants which don't support jumping to events, and calculates RM purely on offset rather than considering RRs.

Bung it in NotificationPanel

Ideally refactor the Panel stack into supporting per-room and per-random ones  (per-random would be good for threading too?)


Problems:
  * How does notifications provide adequate state context? (historical displayname & avatar)
  * Does /sync return enough notif data?

In the longer term, just use filters on /sync and /messages rather than hybrid /sync and /notifications.
But that means being able to paginate globally rather than per room.
